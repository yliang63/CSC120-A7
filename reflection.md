Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded constructors for three of the classes. As I added the boolean of whether the they have elevator when making the building, I reconstruct the class to make no errors and make sure that there are multiple constructing ways. I overloaded showOptions and gotoFloor for each subclass. Since each class have different options, showoptions are all different from each other. I also changed gotoFLoor becuase it is special for those cafe that only have one floor and some house and library do not have elevators.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Most of my code work. I was just kinda having hard time started overloaded and I don't know how it works. I would say reading rubric are helpful as I found my question of how to write something at rubrics.
